# Express.js Route Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for database queries. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

A route handler fetches user data from a database.  If the database query fails, the application crashes or returns an unexpected response.  The bug is the missing error handling in the route handler.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the database query.  Appropriate error responses are returned to the client (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error for database failures).
